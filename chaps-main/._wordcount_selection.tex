        To find the optimal spring stiffness and damping coefficient that minimize the required torque, these parameters were varied and the resulting torque was plotted (Figure~\ref{fig: 3d_plot}). A lower damping coefficient reduces the torque but increases the influence of the system's natural frequency. For the spring constant, there is a specific value that minimizes the torque. It was observed that selecting a spring constant that makes the natural frequency close to \(\omega_{rotor}\) minimizes the required torque.
